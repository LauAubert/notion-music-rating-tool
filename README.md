# notion-music-rating-tool
This repository contains a project developed with Flask and Integromat, which uses the Spotify API to copy music albums to a Notion database. The project allows the user to search for albums on Spotify and add them to their personal database on Notion, allowing for easy organization, album rating and access to album information.
